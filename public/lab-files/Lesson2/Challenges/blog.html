    <p>Code: Mom to the rescue...
        <br>
        <br> I work...relativly hard. I go to school to learn to code to make a better life for my family. I am an avid knitter...I love to cross stitch. I love my kids more than life itself. They are some pretty amazing little human beings, if I do say
        so myself.

        My three little humans are almost out of school for the summer. We are moving onto 4th grade, Kinder and Pre-K! Big Kids!

        <strong>Web development</strong> is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (<em>World Wide Web</em>) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single
        page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include <strong>web engineering</strong>,
        web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design
        aspects of building web sites: <em>writing markup and coding</em>. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms
        the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser. A principle <strong>benefit</strong> of a CMS is that it allows <em>non-technical people</em> tomake changes to their web site without having technical knowledge.

   <h2>About the African Lion</h2>

Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. 
Prides are family units that may include up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young.
All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. 
Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male. <br/>

        <p>The <em>elephant</em> is awesome because it is my <strong>favorite animal</strong>.</p>
        <p>Now originally it was my favorite animal growing up because it was the only animal I could think of that started with the letter <em>E</em> (the first letter of my name). <br>
        However, since adolescence, I have found that the elephant is a fasinating animal and still my favorite.</p>

    <h3 class="big">Here are some reasons to find elephants super cool:</h3>
    
        <p>They are considered a <strong>keystone species</strong> due to their impact on the environment. Basically, they can make
        or break the area they are in depending on their actions.<br> For a positive example, they dig waterholes in times of drought that 
        are later used by other animals. On the flipside, if they tred around an area enough,<br> their massive weight will compact the 
        dirt together making the rain run off and cause erosion.</p>
        
        <p>Elephants are also creatures of importance in African and Asian religions. Certain African tribes considered <br>
        elephants to be the reincarnations of their chieftans and would bury their leaders with the ivory tusks of the elephant.<br>
        In Asian religions such as Hindu, the god <em>Airavata</em>, is the father of elephants and controls rainbows and lightning.<br>
        Another Hindu god, <em>Ganesha</em>, often depicted with an elephant-like head, is believed to be the giver of success and desires.<br>
        In Buddhism, it is believed the <strong>Buddha</strong> himself was reincarnated from a white elephant.</p>

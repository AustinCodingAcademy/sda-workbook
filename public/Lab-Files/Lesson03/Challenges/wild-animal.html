    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
    <p><img src="http://bit.ly/2mtA6V6" alt="http://bit.ly/2rqUA4A">The <em></em> is awesome because <strong></strong>.The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term
        African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding <strong>250 kg (550 lb)</strong> in weight,[5] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger, barring hybrids like the liger.[6][7] Wild lions
        currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (<em>where an endangered remnant population
        resides in and around Gir Forest National Park</em>). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000
        years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: Panthera leo spelaea lived in northern and western Europe and Panthera leo atrox lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.[8] The lion is classified as a vulnerable
        species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of <strong>30â€“50% </strong>over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century.[3] Lion populations
        are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population
        is particularly endangered.</p>

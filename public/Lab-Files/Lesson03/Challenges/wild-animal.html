    <p>The <em>Gorilla</em> is awesome because <strong>strength and intelligence</strong>.</P>
    
    <P>Even though gorillas are physically <strong>large</strong> and look 
    <strong>intimidating</strong>, they are <em>shy</em> animals that live in small <br> 
    groups of 6 to 12, with one dominate male called a 
    <strong>“silverback”</strong> that leads the group. <em>Silverbacks</em> on average <br>
    are about five and half feet tall and weigh about <strong>500 lbs.</strong> 
    with an estimated strength of <strong>20 average men</strong>. The <br> 
    <em>silverback</em> is very protective of his family and will not 
    hesitate to defend them from a threat.  Due to this <br>
    reason, they are usually the most aggressive of he group 
    but some call it just a show of aggression because <br> 
    they make several attempts to scare off anyone that intrudes 
    into the area, they take these steps in an <br> 
    effort to avoid confrontation. They pound their chest, <strong>break 
    small trees</strong> and charge the intruders, most of <br>
    the time this will be enough to make anyone run away, but
    don’t think they are afraid of confrontation, if <br> 
    it comes to it, a <em>silverback</em> will give its <strong>life</strong> protecting 
    his <strong>family</strong>.

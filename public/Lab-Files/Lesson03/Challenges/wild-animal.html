<p style="text-align:center; color:#8e5a1d"> The <em>Lion</em> is awesome because it is one of the <strong>strongest and most powerful</strong> of all the wild creatures. Lions are known to project a <strong>regal and majestic</strong> quality when hunting and caring for their young. They are native to the <strong>sub-Saharan African Desert</strong> and are the the only large cats to travel in groups called "<strong>Prides</strong>." Lions are known to be very <strong>affectionate</strong> towards one another and also very <strong>expressive</strong> through their physical movements and behaviors. Lions are extaordinary animals that symbolize <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>beauty</strong> and I will always admire them.</p>

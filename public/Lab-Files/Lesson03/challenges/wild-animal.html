<h2>Arctic Wolf Facts:</h2> 
<p>The <em>Arctic Wolf</em> is awesome because it can survive in the coldest of climates
Arctic wolves are smaller than grey wolves, They also have smaller ears and shorter muzzles to retain body heat.
The <em>Arctic Wolf</em> is about 40"-70" in length including tail, they can <strong>weight</strong> anywhere from 99-154lbs. The Artic Wolf
has <strong>diet</strong> of mainly <em>muskox</em>, <em>Artic</em> <em>hares</em> and <em>caribou</em>, as the <strong>permafrost</strong> (<em>permanently</em> <em>frozen</em> <em>ground</em>) prevents the Arctic wolf from digging a den,
they typically live in rocky outcrops or caves. Each year the mother wolf gives birth to <strong>two</strong> or <strong>three</strong> pups, the <em>Artic</em> <em>wolf</em> can be found
mainly in the Arctic regions of <strong>North</strong> <strong>Amercia</strong> and <strong>Greenland</strong>.</p>

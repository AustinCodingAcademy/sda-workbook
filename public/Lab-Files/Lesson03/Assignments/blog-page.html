        <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
        <time>March 13th, 2017</time>
        <p>This is my first blog post. It was a fun process to come up with the layout for my first blog post. I started it by looking up other blogs to get some inspiration as to how I wanted it to look. I also took a look at all the HTML elements I could
            use to struture the blog.</p>
        <p>I sketched out they layout in one of my notebooks. I add a picture of it down below. I also came up with the main title and some other element that I would be using as well. Next I would have to decided on the styling, which I completed with some
            CSS. I am looking forward to my continued learning on being a web developer. That way I can continue to make awesome webpages.</p>

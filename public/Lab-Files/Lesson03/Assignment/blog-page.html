        <h2>Journal Entry</h2> 
         <ul><li><p>First Entry: This blog will be dedicated to all things paranormal, from the well known "Mothman" <br>
         or "La Llorona" to tales i've have heard from friends to stories I heard from my grandmother <br>
         as a child, and of course my own personal experiences. I find it curious how this subject <br>
         frigthens people but also intrigues them, and you can include me in that group. I remember<br>
         my brother and I as children begging my <em>abuela</em> to tell us <strong> ghost stories</strong> 
         but then at night having <br>to sleep with the lights on, because as soon as the lights went off, all
         those stories came to <br>life or death, I guess depending on how you looked at it. But every 
         time we saw my grandmother,<br> there we would go again pestering her until she broke down and told us a story.........

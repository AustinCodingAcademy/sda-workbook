			The process of creating a blog page can be challenging if you do not
			know the basics of HTML and CSS.  The key languages central to
			publishing content on the internet.  Both HTML and CSS go hand in
			hand with each other.  HTML adds the basic content and structure.
			CSS is used to further format the layout of elements such as height,
			widths, padding, border, and margins.  This also can include
			background colors, fonts, images, floats, positioning within the of
			the elements within HTML pages.

			On our first day in Intro class, we learned the essential parts
			that build an HTML page.  From the basic anatomy of what an HTML
			element consists of to block vs inline elements and how they affect
			surrounding texts. The basic structure is critical before you
			dive into the HTML elements which provide further structure and
			content.  You have to begin with the essential parts which are as
			follows:

		<ul>
			<li> !DOCTYPE tag </li>
			<li> html tags </li>
			<li> head tag </li>
			<li> meta tag </li>
			<li> title tags </li>
			<li> head tag </li>
			<li> body tags </li>
		</ul>

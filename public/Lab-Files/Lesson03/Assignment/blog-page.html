        <h2>
            1. <em>Claire Standish - "The Breakfast Club"</em>
        </h2>
        <h5>The Breakfast Club is one of the near and deared 80's cult classics. Whether you were the "brain, althete, basket case, princess, or criminal" there was someone who you related to in that movie. The "Princess" character played by Molly Ringwald is an easy costume to replicate.
        <br> All you need is: 
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Pink shirt</li>
            <li>Brown skirt</li>
            <li>Brown boots</li>

    <h2>2. <em>Sandy Olsson - "Grease"</em>
    </h2>
    
    <h5>Grease is one of the most beloved films of last 50 years. This musical set in the 50's full of milkshakes, racecars, and leather jackets is one that is almost the pure definition of a cult classic. The leading female character "Sandra Dee" played by Olivia Newton-John, is one of the most iconic characters and her style in this film is to die for. This outfit is probably the easiest to recreate. 
    <br>What you will need is:  </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Black shirt</li>
        <li>Black leggings</li>
        <li>Black belt</li>
        <li>Red heels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>3. Wednesday Addams - "The Addams Family"</em></h2>
    <h5>The Addams Family movie is another extremely popular cult film that brings the perfect inspiration for a great Halloween costume. All of the characters are well known and provide their own amount of spook to this classic movie. But there is something undeniably great about Wednesday Addams, played by a young Christina Ricci. The film has been recreated many times and you may just as easily recreate this look with some of your most basic staple pieces.
    <br>All you need is:

    <ul>
        <li>White collar shirt</li>
        <li>Black dress</li>

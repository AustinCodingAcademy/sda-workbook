        <p>For the longest time ive been looking for a trade that i am truley passionate about, something that i can wake up
           too on monday and still love what i do for a living. Looking back at some of the things i have attempted with my time
           most could never captivate my interest, or at least for too long. Coding is truely something amazing, the process involved
           is not much of a process to me its more of an adventure each time we gear up the HTML file for something new and and exciting.
           Some might say that the process is "too involoved" that i can agree with while it does take some thought as to placement
           and the idea you're trying to convey, all of which can be resolved with some simple planning.

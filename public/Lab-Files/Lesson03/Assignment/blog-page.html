            <p class="small">This is Halloween, Halloween, Halloween... Happy Halloween everybody!! <br>
            Also, a big Happy Birthday to my grandmother in-law! <br>
            Like most Halloweens of my adult life, I was not thinking that I would dress up this year. <br>
            However, I found my husband's red bowtie and my inner child yearned to come out. <br>
            So in the only work appropriate costume I could think of, I went as the Doctor. The 11th Doctor<br>
            to be exact, since bowties and fezzes are cool. I also carried around a purse that looks like<br>
            Mary Poppin's bag with an umbrella and tape measure in it just in case no one went for the Doctor idea. <br>
            I was pleasantly surprised that more peopled guessed my costume as the Doctor than as Mary Poppins. <br>
            But that doesn't mean that I am not still 'practically perfect in every way'.</p>

            <p class="small">Whose has two thumbs and it's their birthday today? That's right, ME!! I am now 27 years old. <br>
            Now I don't think the universe got the memo that it was my birthday (aka please go easy on my today)...<br>
            Nope. First off it's a Tuesday (not as bad as Monday, but still), and then my husband tells me he has to go <br>
            into work 30 minutes early (wake-up time now 5:30am...zzz) and my boss tells me to come in to work an hour early. <br>
            After going through a very uneventful, albeit sleep-deprived, day at work, I then had my coding class in the evening. <br>
            Which I love, don't get me wrong, but definitely no special dinner/party/watch Netflix and drink wine tonight. <br>
            Oh God... does this mean I'm old?</p>

            <p class="small">For those of you who aren't aware and are too lazy to read the About Me section (no worries, I feel ya), I am in a band<br>
            called: Erin & Evan. Named after yours truly and the amazingly talented, Evan. Super easy for us to remember. <br>
            Well, we had a show today at Alamo Beer Company, it was a three hour set from 2-5pm. Now these sets are usually pretty <br>
            grueling since even though it's 'October', it's still summer weather here in Texas. But luckily, we had a nice breeze today <br>
            which meant that people could sit out on the patio to listen to us without sweating their coconuts off. We are working on<br>
            getting our album finished, it is moving slowly, but stea...nope just slowly, but eventually we will get there to a<br>
            finished album/cd/mp3 etc. You can find the link to some of our older songs in the SoundCloud link in the Music section of this blog.</p>
    
        <h3 class="date">October 11th, 2016</h3>
            <p class="small">Today is a very special day! Not only is it the first blog entry on my "The Musical Nerd" blog (aka You are Here),<br>
            but it is also the first day of my coding classes. I am extremely excited to finally get started and honestly <br>
            (here comes the earning of the title 'Nerd'), I'm excited to go back to school! Well not <em>school</em> school,<br>
            but to be in a classroom setting again and learning something new... makes me giddy. Now those of you who read the <br>
            'About Me' section are probably asking, "But you are a musician, your passion is music, why aren't you going back to <br>
            school for music?" Well... short answer: because music doesn't pay my student loans. I would rather have a job that <br>
            I enjoy that gives me the paycheck to be able to continue to pursue my passion and dreams than stay at my hourly<br>
            'music' job, where I don't actually do any music and get grossly underpaid. So yeah... I have a feeling Code Monkey is going<br>
            to be stuck in my head for the majority of this class.  Oh and a Happy Happy Birthday tomorrow to my sister in-law, <br>
            Alison, who is the writer of my favorite transplant Texan in Seatle blog, Swears and Sweet Tea.</p>

        <h2 id="about-me" class="heading">About Me aka The Musical Nerd</h2>
            <p class="small">Hello, my name is Erin and I am your run-of-the-mill musically talented nerd. Texas born and raised<br>
            on a farm is where I did not spend most of my days. Try more like suburbs of Houston. Went to college up <br>
            in almost Oklahoma North Texas at Austin College (Go Roos!) and against all judgement studies music. <br>
            Now don't get me wrong, I loved getting my degree in Music, but I do wish I had double majored in something <br>
            relatively marketable. And by marketable, I mean for more than $9/hr that wasn't a call center. Hindsight is <br>
            20/20. Anyways...met my husband at college, got married a week after graduation (don't try this at home kids), <br>
            and promptly moved away to New Hampshire. All the while, I am a big BIG fan of shows like Doctor Who, Sherlock, <br>
            and Agents of Shield, and have become ingrained in the fandom life in my spare time (aka 'Nerd' part of me). I am<br>
            half of a folk duo band called 'Erin & Evan' where Evan and I sing, play guitar (Evan), play mandolin (me), and <br>
            make/write generally good music. We are working on an album of originals that we have written and recorded with the <br>
            help of our good friend, Reo. I am positive you will hear all about the progress of this in the above blog posts. <br>
            Enough about me, now go read things that I thought of and wrote. DFTBA!</p>

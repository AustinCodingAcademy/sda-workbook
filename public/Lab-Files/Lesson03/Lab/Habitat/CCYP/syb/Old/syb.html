    <h1>Join a Summer Build for Teenagers</h1>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>The Summer Youth Blitz</em> is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth,
            <br/>ages 16 to 18, from high schools and youth organizations around the United States.
            <br/>During this program, 15 to 20 youth participants and adult leaders <br/>"blitz build" an entire Habitat house in two weeks.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The house build, an unfamiliar activity for most, provides a common,
            <br/>nonthreatening ground for building relationships and teams.
        </p>
        <!-- Bulleted list removed by request of the lab exercise, Wesley Supnet
    <p>During the house build, you will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help lay the foundation. </li>
            <li>Assist in framing the home. </li>
            <li>Do simple carpentry, under supervision. </li>
        </ul> 
-->
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            In the evenings, the youth participate in activities like team-building games,
            <br/>leadership development, local cultural events or community dinners.
        </p>

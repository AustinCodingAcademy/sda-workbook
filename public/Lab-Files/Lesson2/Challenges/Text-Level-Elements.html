    <p><strong>Web development</strong> is a <em>broad term</em> for the work involved in developing a <strong>web site</strong> for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an <em>intranet</em> (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of <strong>content management systems</strong> or<strong> CMS.</strong> These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as <em>middleware</em> between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web site <strong>without</strong> having technical knowledge.</p>

        <h3>Saturday Night Bomber Flights (SNBF) Recruitment Post</h3>
        Человек чести (Men of Honor)…<br>
        <br>
        Yesterday, our Motherland sent us new planes and military equipment. Our ground crews worked all night to prepare our planes with new guns for battle. Our i16s and MIG-3s now have 20mm wing mounted cannons; it's everything we need for killing more enemies. So today we have the honor to join the battle for stop the Axis hordes who invaded our land. The Soviet people look to us with hope, we must not let them down! We can not retreat anymore. The Moscow is behind us! Our cause is right, the enemy will be defeated, the victory will be ours!<br>
        
        <strong>Pilots are Needed!</strong><br>
            <ul> 
                <li>If you are tired of the game play of single-player or the usual or stereotypical multiplayer experience, then may I present to you SNBF. Here are the huddled masses of professional pilots who appreciate radio etiquette, formation flying, teamwork and tactics, as well as suffering the consequences of mistakes with only one virtual life for the mission. Here you cannot afford to be a maverick nor do we tolerate them.</li>
                <li>If you enjoy history, love WWII aviation (especially the Eastern Front... for now), and want to immerse yourself in the shoes of a Eastern Front WWII pilot (Fighter, Bomber, or Attack) then I highly recommend that you give this campaign a shot.</li>
                <li>If you are interested and want more information, please check out the topic <a href="https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/topic/20918-saturday-night-bombers-flight/?p=471595">here at the official forums</a>.</li>
                <li>If you would like to register for a spot on either the Luftwaffe or VVS then <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyQ4mAHvC-e-EZnmwmGRATS5lyFVWQac9K6i1L89yToQWPxA/viewform">please go here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        This is not your typical multiplayer experience.<br>
        Here we:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold formation</li>
                <li>Watch our wingman's six o'clock, both high and low</li>
                <li>Call out all contacts, bogey or bandit, and hold formation until told to engage</li>
                <li>Use tactics</li>
               <li>Cherish our virtual life</li>
            </ul>
        This is one of the best ways to experience IL2: Sturmovik: Battle of Moscow/Stalingrad/Kuban/Midway<br>
        If you enjoyed the campaigns from IL2: Cliffs of Dover or IL2: 1946, then this should be an experience you will enjoy.<br>
        If you have VR then I truly envy you, because you can experience history in a whole new way and shed some light on just what then brave men and women, of both sides, faced as they did what they were told for someone who will never know their name. Their equipment, their situation, and maybe even their fear, will come to take on a new understanding.
        Plus it is extremely fun!

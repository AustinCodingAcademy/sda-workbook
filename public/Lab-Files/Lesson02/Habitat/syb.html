    <h2>Join a Summer Build for Teenagers.</h2> <hr>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>The Summer Youth Blitz</em>is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth, ages 16 to 18, 
    from high schools and youth organizations around the United States. During this program, 15 to 20 
    youth participants and adult leaders "blitz build" an entire Habitat house in two weeks.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    <p>The house build, an unfamiliar activity for most, provides a common, nonthreatening ground for building 
    relationships and teams.</p>
    <!--
    <p>During the house build, you will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help lay foundation.</li>
        <li>Assist in framing the home.</li>
        <li>Do simple carpentry, under supervision.</li>
    </ul>
    -->
    <!--Bulleted list removed at the request of supervisor, Jane Doe.-->
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
    <p>In the evenings, the youth participate in activities like team-building games, leadership development, 
    local cultural events or community dinners.</p>
    </blockquote>

    place during the months of June, July and August.</p>

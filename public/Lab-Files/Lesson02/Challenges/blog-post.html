    <h1>Favorite Poems</h1>
    <p>You have brains in your head.<br>
You have feet in your shoes.<br>
You can steer yourself in any direction you choose.<br>
You’re on your own.<br>
And you know what you know.<br>
You are the guy who’ll decide where to go.<br>
<em>~Dr. Seuss</em></p>
<p>I tripped on my shoelace<br>
And I fell up—<br>
Up to the roof tops,<br>
Up over the town,<br>
Up past the tree tops,<br>
Up over the mountains,<br>
Up where the colors<br>
Blend into the sounds.<br>
But it got me so dizzy<br>
When I looked around,<br>
I got sick to my stomach<br>
And I threw down.<br>
<em>~ Shel Silverstein</em></p>

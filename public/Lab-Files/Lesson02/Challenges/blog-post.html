    <h1>Welcome to Erin's Music Blog</h1>
    <p>It is one of the best feelings when you have a song stuck in your head all day
    and then you get in the car and it is magically on the radio.<br>
    It's like the universe is confirming that you were meant to think of that song. I love it.

    <p><strong>Story time:</strong><br><blockquote>My boss at work is a bit of a joker. He likes to make puns and likes to mess with people.<br>
    Today I went up to him to ask him a question. I started, "Do you.." as in Do you know what is up with this person's account.<br>
    But of course, he immediately interupts and says, "have the time? to listen to me whine?...". *sigh*<br>
    And of course being the perfectionist I am, I had to finish with, "about nothing and everything all at once."</blockquote><br>
    Every day is a struggle.</p>

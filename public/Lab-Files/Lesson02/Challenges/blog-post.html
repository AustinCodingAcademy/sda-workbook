    <p>This blog will be dedicated to all things paranormal, from the well known<br>
        "Mothman" or "La Llorona" to tales i've have heard from friends to<br>
        stories I heard from my grandmother as a child, and of course my own<br>
        personal experiences. I find it curious how this subject frigthens people<br>
        but also intrigues them, and you can include me in that group. I remember<br>
        my brother and I as children begging my <em>abuela</em> to tell us <strong> ghost stories</strong><br>
        but then at night having to sleep with the lights on, because as soon as the<br>
        lights went off, all those stories came to life or death, I guess depending on<br>
        how you looked at it. But every time we saw my grandmother, there we would go<br>
        again pestering her until she broke down and told us a story<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>So, this is the first of many posts to come. I hope it will entertain some,<br>
        scare others, and maybe remind some of things they may have heard or seen<br>
        but had forgotten or maybe wanted to forget. So here we go, my abuela<br>
        told us a story about...............

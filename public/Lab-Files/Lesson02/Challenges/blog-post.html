    Bert's Web Blog Post
</h1>
<p>So this is my first blog post using html to code, one of the things i enjoy about coding is you can do it solo<br>
TBH i've never really been a people person but that is a skill that i am working on, soon i will love all people lol <br>
YEAH RIGHT! stop playing internal thought of my mind, hence why i wanted to code you could spend hours and hours just doing this<br>
alone but then again you could die alone and who would want all that nonsense??? welp this is bert.C sigining off peace free world</p>

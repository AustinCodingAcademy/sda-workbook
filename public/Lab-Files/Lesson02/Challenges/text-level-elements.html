    <p><strong>Web development</strong> is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the<br>
    <em>Internet</em> (World Wide Web) or an <em>intranet</em> (a private network). Web development can range <br>
    from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based <br>
    internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more <br>
    comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web <br>
    engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side <br>
    scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among <br>
    web professionals, "<em>web development</em>" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of <br>
    building web sites: <strong>writing markup and coding</strong>. Most recently Web development has come to <br>
    mean the creation of content management systems or <strong>CMS</strong>. These CMS can be made from scratch,<br>
    proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database <br>
    and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical <br>
    people to make changes to their web site without having technical knowledge.</p>

    <p><strong>Web development</strong>is a broad term for the work involved in developing
    a web site for the <strong>Internet</strong> (World Wide Web) or an <strong>intranet</strong> (a private
    network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static
    single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet
    applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
    A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly
    refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content
    development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server
    and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
    Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main
    non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most
    recently Web development has come to mean the creation of <strong>content
    management systems</strong> or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch,
    proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware
    between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit
    of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their
    web site <em>without</em> having technical knowledge.

    <p style="text-align:left"><em>Web development</em> is a broad term for the work involved in developing a 
    web site for the <strong>Internet</strong> (World Wide Web) or an <strong>intranet</strong> (a private network). 
    Web development can range from developing the simplest static single 
    page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications,
    electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
    list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web
    engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, 
    client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security 
    configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, 
    <strong>"web development"</strong> usually refers to the main non-design aspects of 
    building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most recently Web 
    development has come to mean the creation of <em>content management 
    systems</em> or <strong>CMS</strong>. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary 
    or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the 
    database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS 
    is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web 
    site without having technical knowledge.</p>

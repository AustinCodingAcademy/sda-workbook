<p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet <em>(World Wide Web)</em> or an intranet <em>(a private network)</em>. Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, <strong>"web development"</strong>usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or <strong>CMS</strong>. These <strong>CMS</strong> can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms the <strong>CMS</strong> acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a <strong>CMS</strong> is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web site without having technical knowledge.+

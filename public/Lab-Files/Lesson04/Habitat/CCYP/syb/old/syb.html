<h1>Join a Summer Build for Teenagers</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <em>Summer Youth Blitz</em> is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth,<br/>ages 16 to 18, 
from high schools and youth organizations around the United States. <br/>During this program, 15 to 20 
youth participants and adult leaders <br/>"blitz build" an entire Habitat house in two weeks.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
The house build, an unfamiliar activity for most, provides a common, 
<br/>nonthreatening ground for building relationships and teams.
</p>

<!--
<p>During the house build, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help lay the foundation. </li>
<li>Assist in framing the home. </li>
<li>Do simple carpentry, under supervision. </li>
</ul>
-->
<!-- Bulleted list removed at the request of supervisor, Jane Doe.-->

</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>
In the evenings, the youth participate in activities like team-building games, <br/>leadership development, 
local cultural events or community dinners.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
This program is sponsored by national grant donations and coordinated by the Campus Chapters<br/> and Youth 
Programs department of Habitat for Humanity International. For the past several years, <br/>funding has allowed 
for three blitz builds per summer--two in the United States and one outside <br/>the country. The builds take 
place during the months of June, July and August.
</p>
